Once upon a time there was a girl named Ellie. She spent all her days trying to figure out calculus and computer science. Even though there were a lot of assignments, she was really trying to get her degree. She sat in the apartment with her trusty laptop and a family sized bag of popcorn, trying to decipher runtimes and derivatives. 
Ellie suddenly had an epiphany. She realized that grinding out work on derivatives and runtimes would enable her to buy more family sized bags of popcorn! This encouraged her to face her course-work head on. With renewed confidence, she set out to prepare for this week's exams. Unfortunately for Ellie, she ran out of popcorn in a short while. 
Some time later she looked at the clock and realised it was 2:00 AM. She had stayed up all night trying to prepare and knew that it that is important to get a good night's rest. The next day, she woke up and looked at her notes from the night before, and the lightbulb lit up inside her head. She finally understood how the derivative of sin(x) was cos(x). :)
