beginning:
Once upon a time there was a girl named Ellie. She spent all her days trying to figure out calculus and computer science. 
Even though there are a lot of assignments, she is really trying to get her degree. She sits in the apartment with her
trusty laptop and a family sized bag of popcorn, trying to decipher runtimes and derivatives.
